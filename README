CONVERT Info Sheet

CONVERT is a Phyton application which implements the conversions between the
psychometric diagnostic instruments used to interview help-seeking subjects
for a clinical high risk for psychosis (HR), according to the algorithm and
equipercentile linking table proposed by Fusar-Poli et al. in Schizophr Bull
2015 (under review).

TOWARDS A STANDARD PSYCHOMETRIC DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW FOR PEOPLE AT HIGH
CLINICAL RISK FOR PSYCHOSIS: CAARMS vs SIPS. Schizophrenia Bulletin 2015
(under review).

To start the software execute the convert.py in the command prompt.
The software takes as input a *.xlsx file (attached Input_Template) and
produces as output a *.xlsx file.
Clicking on File menu/Open, the user can browse the directories and open
the selected input file.

Functions included in the software are:

 - CAARMS to SIPS
 - SIPS to CAARMS

For each of them the software provides the conversion of the diagnostic
subgroup (columns “CAARMS Main Diagnosis” and “SIPS Main Diagnosis”)
across the two instruments, and of the individual scores of the severity
or frequency subscales. The latter were provided for analytical purposes
only (e.g., to correlate severity/frequency with other external variables).
We do not recommend to use the converted severity or frequency to assign
the diagnostic subgroup as a first step. The functions are accessible via
the Run pull-down menu.

The supported input diagnostic subgroups are:

 1. HR –
 2. GRD
 3. GRD/APS
 4. APS
 5. BLIPS
 6. GRD/BLIPS
 7. Psychosis

The supported output diagnostic subgroups are:

 1. HR –
 2. GRD
 3. APS
 4. BLIPS
 5. psychosis

The GRD+APS and GRD+BLIPS group have been combined with the APS and BLIPS
group respectively, as suggested by Nelson et al. 2011 [1].
Besides the main diagnosis and the individual ratings, in order to proceed
to the conversion of cases, the software requires the following clinical
information, which should be part of the routine psychometric assessment,
namely:

1. Comorbidities which can better explain the symptoms (column “Symptoms B/E
Comorbidities”, values: yes/no), required to convert APS from CAARMS to SIPS
and HR – from SIPS to CAARMS [2], [3];

2. Disorganising and dangerous symptoms (column “DD Symptoms”, values:
yes/no), required to convert BLIPS from CAARMS to SIPS and psychosis from SIPS
to CAARMS [2], [3];

3. GAF drop > 30% (column “GAF drop > 30%”, values: yes/no), required to convert
APS from SIPS to CAARMS. Please note GAF drop not required to convert BLIPS
category from SIPS to CAARMS [2], [3].

When these data are missing, the user will be given warning messages. The user
can then decide to interrupt the program, enter the data in the input *.xlsx
file and rerun the program, or if the data are not available, to proceed and
exclude the cases. In both cases the subjects with missing info will be listed
in the main screen.
The Save as item in the File menu allows to save the output *.xlsx file in the
selected directory.
The Help pull-down menu displays a basic guide about the software use.
